Comfortable Image Chooser Block for the NextGEN Gallery 

== Description ==

[NextGEN Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) (NGG) is an excellent gallery for WordPress. Its major drawback, as far as I'm concerned, is the limited possiblity to insert selected images into posts. This image chooser offers a comfortable way to browse through hierarchical albums and galleries, insert NGG tags for albums and galleries, as well as NGG tags for one or more images and thumbnails at a time.

* On the left side of the image chooser pop-up there is the tree view of all albums and galleries. On the top are the albums and their galleries, then follow the galleries, which are not attached to any album.
* On the upper right side there are the controls to insert the tags with their relevant options.
* Below the controls, the thumbnails of the images in the selected gallery are shown, optionally together with their title, summary and description. There multiple images can be selected for insertion. 

Default settings can be altered on the settings page.

At this time, the image chooser is available in English.
